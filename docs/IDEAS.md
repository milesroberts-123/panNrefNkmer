# Potential graph genomes to use

Ideally, I want

- genome fasta and gff of individual genotypes

- vg genome graph of all genomes combined

[tea pangenome](https://www.tea-pangenome.cn/)

[11 species pangenome database](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/plantpan/)

[M. polymorpha](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-02071-4) - this paper has genome fastas, but no pangenome graph
